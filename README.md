# Setup

From the repo's root folder:

1. Compile the files: `javac newbank/*/*.java`
2. Start the Server: `java newbank.server.NewBankServer`
3. Start the Client (in a new terminal session): `java newbank.client.ExampleClient`

You interact with the CLI from a terminal where you started the Client.

N.B. You can also setup configuration to run above commands in your IDE,
to make development easier.
